          <p>(Sports  Network)  - The Nashville Predators were the surprise playoff club in
 2003-04, and now the team hopes to get back to the postseason and take things
 a step further.</p>
          <p>During the offseason the club's big splash was the signing of Paul Kariya, who
 hopes to return to a superstar level after a down year with the Colorado
 Avalanche.</p>
          <p>The team also bolstered its defense with the acquisition of Danny Markov from
 Philadelphia, and re-signed many of its key cogs.</p>
          <p>Head coach Barry Trotz is the only bench boss the team has had since its
 inception in 1998, and in 03-04 he finally put things together on the ice. The
 Preds were a gritty bunch that wasn't intimidated by the upper echelon clubs.
 This was evident by its rivalry with Detroit during the regular season, and a
 valiant effort in the first round.</p>
          <p>That grit and gumption now has a bona fide star to lead its effort, spurring
 hope for a second straight postseason berth.</p>
          <p>FORWARDS - Kariya and Teemu Selanne went to Colorado as a package deal before
 the last NHL season, and the whole thing was a bust. Kariya battled injury
 during the campaign, tallying only 11 goals and 25 assists in 51 games. The
 seven-time All-Star posted 25 goals and 56 assists in a full season for
 Anaheim in 02-03, eventually leading the Ducks to the Stanley Cup Finals.</p>
          <p>Kariya is a terrific lead horse for a stable of young forwards who have really
 been without a leader. David Legwand is a prime talent who had been an enigma
 for his first few seasons. In 03-04 he tallied 18 goals and 28 assists,
 including five game-winning goals.</p>
          <p>Scott Walker is a guy who has been injury-prone throughout his career, but
 came through with a career effort last time out (25g, 42a). Walker is only
 5-10, 196 pounds but plays tougher than his size. Greg Johnson returns to
 supply leadership and stability, while former first-rounder Scott Hartnell
 hopes to escape the obscurity of fourth-line duty.</p>
          <p>Veteran speedster Steve Sullivan hopes to get back on track after being
 injured for most of the last two seasons. He was a 25-35-goal scorers a few
 years back with Chicago, and the Preds could sure use that spark. You have to
 wonder if all those years as an undersized NHL forward are finally taking a
 toll.</p>
          <p>The Predators have a nice amount of toughness up front as well, with Darcy
 Hordichuk, Scott Nichol and the wild Jordin Tootoo in the fold.</p>
          <p>DEFENSE - Markov became available when the Philadelphia Flyers needed to clear
 some cap space. He combined for six goals and 13 assists in 78 games for the
 Flyers and Hurricanes last time out, and is a guy who can log quality minutes
 in every situation. Markov is a tough guy to play against, as he is quick on
 his skates and plays physically.</p>
          <p>Kimmo Timonen is the team's puck mover and power-play QB, having tallied 12
 goals and 32 assists in 77 games back in 03-04. Timonen has bagged at least
 12 scores on three occasions during his six-season career.</p>
          <p>Marek Zdlicky is another offensive blueliner, netting 14 goals with 39 assists
 in 82 games as a rookie in 03-04. Acquired in the Mike Dunham trade with New
 York a few years back, Zdlicky especially lifted the Preds' power-play unit,
 accounting for nine goals and 26 assists with the man advantage.</p>
          <p>Former first-round pick Dan Hamhius stepped in and made an impact in 03-04,
 and the club hopes for the same from Ryan Suter. Suter, who has a family
 pedigree, was the club's top choice in 2003. He played collegiately at
 Wisconsin and went pro last season, posting seven goals, 16 assists and 70
 penalty minutes in 63 games for the Milwaukee Admirals of the AHL.</p>
          <p>GOALTENDING - Tomas Vokoun has emerged as a viable workhorse goaltender for
 the Preds, as he started 73 games in 03-04. The Czech went 34-29-10 with a
 2.53 goals-against average and .909 save percentage. Vokoun played well in the
 first-round series against Detroit too, holding the Red Wings to 12 goals in
 six games.</p>
          <p>Chris Mason will likely serve as Vokoun's backup, after appearing in 17 games
 (nine starts) during 03-04. He went 4-4-1 with a 2.18 GAA and .926 SP.</p>
          <p>WHEN ALL IS SAID AND DONE - The Predators caught teams by surprise in 03-04
 with their hard-nosed, no-fear play. Teams will expect it this time around, so
 the onus will be on the skill players to raise their games. This begins with
 Kariya, who hopes to have a rebound season for a club that has many of its key
 parts returning. The Nashville brass has been patient with its young players,
 and it has paid off to this point.</p>
